My research activities have been focused in separation processes, namely ion exchange and chromatography. I have studied the isolation and purification of bioactive compounds from biomass residues, with an emphasis on modeling and optimization using phenomenological models, statistical techniques and numerical methods. In recent years I have also become interested in the application of data analysis and Artificial Intelligence in the field of chemical engineering. .
